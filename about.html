            I’m a Senior Implementation Specialist based in Atlanta GA with a
            passion for solving problems streamlining digital workflows and
            guiding clients through seamless transitions. With 5+ years of
            experience in training onboarding and client success I specialize in
            translating complex systems into smooth efficient processes that
            work for both teams and end users. <br />
            My love for tech started in middle school and has grown into a
            skillset I now use to build websites create digital content and
            enhance user experiences. Along the way I’ve sharpened my skills
            through SheCodes boot camps and freelance projects gaining
            proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. For me coding isn’t
            about leaving implementation it’s about adding value. Whether
            building internal tools polishing digital touchpoints or giving
            clients that extra layer of support I see technology as a way to
            create connect and contribute. At heart I’m a people first problem
            solver who happens to love clean code and clever interfaces.
